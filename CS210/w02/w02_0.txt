Lexer: Strings

This assignmet builds off the previous one. In this assignemnt you are to 
expand your previous code to recognize strigns in CCX.

   Strings:
      Strings in CCX are literals delimited by double-quotes ”like this”. The
      double-quotes are part of the lexeme. When you print a lexeme that has
      been classified as a string, you must print the double-quotes. You may
      assume that your lexer will never encounter a string that is more than 256
      characters long.
      Be carefule. Strings "can containg spaces", be in the beginning, middle 
      or end of a line, ......... and just to make it fun we will allow stings 
      to come after another "like""this".
      When a string is encountered, print it out like this: 
String: "The string you found"

Anything that is not a string should still be labeled as a token.
