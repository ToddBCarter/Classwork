#
# This program uses much of the same from Assignment 4.
# New functions to handle the new data lists were added.
#
# Information added for the turtles:
#   names[] - List of the turtle names.
#   move[()] - List of paired lower and upper movement bounds. (2 requirements)
#   odds[] - List of odds modifiers for a stall chance.
#   home[] - List of hometowns for the turtles.

# Functions for lists added in Assignment 5 start here:

#as required by the assignment, each held in a coordinate pair:

#Stall chance, or chance turtle won't move:

#
# For Assignment 5, the forward movement variables were changed to
# be elements from the movement list indexed to each turtle.
# Element [i][0] is minimum movement, and [i][1] is maximum movement.
