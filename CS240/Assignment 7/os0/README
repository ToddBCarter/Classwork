Test Cases and Expected Results.

job0a0:
  This job has no process.  The operating system simple creates the Null 
  process and then attempts to Dispatch a process and since none is
  available, it halts.  This is testing the Dispatch transition function's
  ability to stop when there are no more live processes to execute.

job0a: pro0a
  This job has a single process with a single Halt instruction that
  should run for only 1 time period and then halt.  This is testing
  all the basic operations, reading a job file, reading a process
  file, creating a process, dispatching a process, killing a process.

job0a2: pro0a
        pro0a
        pro0a
  This job has three processes that each have a single Halt instruction.
  This is testing the dispatching of several processes.

job0b1: pro0b2
  This job has a single process with three INST instructions and a Halt
  instruction that should run for 4 time periods and then halt.  This is
  testing the execution of a series of instructions.

job0b2: pro0b1
        pro0b2
        pro0b3
  This job has a three processes that have two, three, and four INST
  instructions (respectively) and a Halt instruction.  The total
  execution time for this job should be 12 time periods.  This is
  testing the execution of several processes with several instructions
  each, for this test to be successful the state of each process must be
  correctly maintained and the correct value for the program counter must
  be provided.

job0c1: pro0c2
  This job has a single process with seven INST instructions and a Halt
  instruction that should run for 8 time periods and then halt.  This job
  runs long enough that the round-robin scheduling algorithm sends the
  process back to the Ready state with a Timeout transition.  This is
  testing the Timeout transition.

job0c2: pro0c1
        pro0c2
        pro0c3
  This job has a three processes that each have six, seven, and eight
  INST instructions (respectively) and a Halt instruction.  All these
  processes run long enough so that they Timeout and return to the Ready
  state when a round-robin scheduling algorithm is used.  The round-robin
  scheduling algorithm is required to deal with a number of partially
  executed processes, so that it will need to correctly save and restore 
  the state of each process.  This is testing the proper use of the ready
  queue, the accuracy of the PCB information (such as PC), and the
  successful termination of a number of processes.

job0d: pro0d1
       pro0d2
       pro0d3
       pro0d4
       pro0d5
  This job is run with three different parameter files, so that it will
  use all three scheduling algorithms.  It will display the execution of
  the example used in the text on page 145 in section 5.6.1 Deterministic
  Modeling.

job0e1: pro0e1
  This job has a single process with a NOOP instruction, which is illegal
  since only the Null process can use the NOOP instruction.  This is 
  testing if the NOOP instruction will be correctly flagged as an illegal
  instruction.

job0e2: pro0e2
  This job has a single process with an illegal instruction (opcode is 55).
  This is testing if an illegal instruction will be correctly flagged as such.

job0e3: pro0xxx
  This job refers to a process file that does not exist.  This is testing
  the appropriateness of the error message for a missing process file.

job0xxx
  This job does not exist and should produce a "job file not found" error.

job0a paraxxxx
  This job attempts to use a parameter file that does not exist and so it
  should produce a "parameter file not found" error.

Here is the actual output from some of the above jobs.

Output from job file = job0b2.
